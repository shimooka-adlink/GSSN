This software package contains:
- S1C31W74 product files

IMPORTANT
=========

Setup batch files are located in the SETUP\S1C31W74\ARM folder.
Two setup batch files need to be executed before using the Keil IDE for the S1C31W74:

1)  setup-keil.bat:
   This batch file copies the flash loader FLM files needed by uVision to the Keil installation folder.

2)  setup-debugger-jlink.bat:
   This batch file generates the appropriate .uvoptx files en-masse for the sample software projects.

To run a batch file, right-click on the file and "Run as administrator" and ensure
visually that no errors occur.  If "Run as administrator" option does not exist,
then run "cmd" as an administrator and execute batch file that way.
